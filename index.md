And now my brag sheet!

I played for the varsity boys volleyball team in 2022 and on the team itself, I played the position of opposite hitter. 

I was a former bassoonist in concert band for East Brunswick High School, Churchill Junior High School, as well as Hammarskjold Middle School. For those of you that do not know what a bassoon is, it is basically a low woodwind, almost like a clarinet, except much deeper in sound and bigger. A bassoon looks like this:

Also, I played for the Wind Ensemble in the 9th grade, which is basically like Concert Band Honors almost. 

I have also done taekwondo in the past for a couple of years, and I had been able to reach up to the brown belt which was just two belts short of a black belt. 


Thank you for taking a quick peek at my website...I hope you enjoyed it!!
